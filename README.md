# Audio-encryption-decryption-image-format-secured-channel
A novel approach to securely encrypt audio files (.wav) and transmit it through a Additive White Gaussian Noise Channel (AWGN) in an .TIFF image format and decrypt the audio at the receiver end and calculated the Bit Error Rate and Noise Generated.

**Abstract**

This paper describes an algorithm of encrypting wave files in image format with a randomly generated orthogonal key decrypting them after being passed through a channel with white Gaussian noise. Gaussian noise is then removed and then matrix manipulations are done, to get the original audio back. In this age of information, audio encryption can be a secure way to communicate between individuals with assurance of privacy of the data.
